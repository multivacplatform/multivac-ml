    "in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized the strict performance of these forms without " +
    "troubling about their purport or significance.@@ Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master of the principal " +

    "joined.@@ These according to Pierre's observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for anything, " +
    "but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their" +
    " connections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge.@@ Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what" +
    " he was doing.@@ Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals.@@" +
    " He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path" +
    " and deviated from its original principles.@@ And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated" +
    " into the higher secrets of the order.@@ What is to be done in these circumstances?@@ To favor revolutions, overthrow" +
    " everything, repel force by force?@@ No!@@ We are very far from that.@@ Every violent reform deserves censure, for it" +
    " quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no violence.@@ \"But" +
    " what is there in running across it like that?\" said Ilagin's groom.@@ \"Once she had missed it and turned it" +
    " away, any mongrel could take it,\" Ilagin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop and his" +
    " excitement."
